# DoorFinder
DoorFinder is a web application designed to solve the problem of locating specific doors in complex buildings and blocks. Whether you're a delivery driver struggling to find an entry or a host guiding friends to your home, DoorFinder simplifies navigation with personalized door-finding guides.

Users can sign up or log in to create detailed finders using pictures, GIFs, and text descriptions, or use the app as a guest to access guides shared by others through links. By including a DoorFinder link in delivery instructions or invitations, users can provide precise, visual directions, saving time and reducing frustration for everyone involved.
